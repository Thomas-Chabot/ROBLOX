# Connect
Allows you to connect roblox studio to your editor of choice. This is a slightly modified version of old code I wrote ~ a year ago. It's pretty buggy so you probably shouldn't rely on it.
If you decide to use it, back up all of your code beforehand.

# How to use
Take the plugin.lua file and put it into the studio plugins folder.

Create a new folder.
Put main.js inside your new folder.

Run main.js with the node cmd prompt.

Open up a new roblox studio window.




Add -- $connect scriptname.lua to the top of any script you're going to edit.

The "e to r" button sends data from the text editor to the script.
